## About the Club
AmFOSS (FOSS@Amrita) is a computer-science club based in [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://amrita.edu), Amritapuri Campus, aimed at the holistic development of a student. The club members work after the college hours until late night, in a dedicated lab, under ther solid training and mentorship of the senior members, and are introduced to the world of technologies and guided to contribute to FOSS. AmFOSS is a family upholding the values of sharing and caring, and it simulates a real life working environment with all its ups and downs, growing the student to a strong, confident and talented professional. The club members very actively participate in various contests, conferences, hackathons etc., and through the hardwork and passion of the members, we are globally ranked among the TOP 10 by the number of GSoC participants (in the period 2005-2016).
