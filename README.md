# **Project**

It’s been 10+ years now that amFOSS came into existence. We are a community of students who support and guide each other towards making open source contributions, which not only helps them to build their technical skills but also helps them to contribute back to the society. Being one of the most active student communities of the country, we have made our presence felt all over. We have been getting a lot of exposure & opportunities via different platforms such as conferences & social media to name a few.

**Idea / Goal of the club**: To be a better human being.


## **How to Contribute?**

## **Getting started**

Getting started with contributing to this is really easy with just one step away from contributing to foss@amrita. So let’s get you started,
Fork the repository
[https://github.com/amfoss/website]

Do a direct clone, so that you can get familiarised with the code base. Moreover a cloned copy on your local system will help you to reproduce bugs and see the changes you make real time.

git clone [https://github.com/amfoss/fosswebsite.git]


## **Pre-requisites**
1. Install requirements:
  All the requirements are mentioned in the file
   ```requirements.txt```

    ```pip install -r docs/requirements.txt```

2. Install ```python-pip```, ```python-dev``` and ```virtualenvwrapper```

    ```bash
       sudo apt-get install
       python-pip python-dev
       sudo -H pip install virtualenvwrapper
    ```


## **Installing**
1. First, some initialization steps. Most of this only needs to be done one time.
Add the command to source:
           ```/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh``` to your shell startup file
            (```.bashrc``` or ```.zshrc```)
            changing the path to ```virtualenvwrapper.sh```, depending on where it was installed by ```pip```.

      ```bash
        export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
        mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
        source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
      ```

2. Lets create a virtual environment for our project

      ```bash
         mkvirtualenv --python=which python3 foss
         workon foss
      ```

3. Now to set up the database
   In the development phase, we use sqlite3.db

    * Setup tables in the DB

      ```python
         python manage.py makemigrations
         python manage.py migrate
      ```

    * Collect all the static files for fast serving

      ```python
         python manage.py collectstatic
      ```

    * For creating an admin account

      ```python
         python manage.py createsuperuser
      ```
4. Run server

      ```python
         python manage.py runserver
      ```

Through Analytics, we can monitor how long users stay on our website, what pages/sections they are visiting the most, which page/section is causing the users to leave most often and much more. This would help in substantially improving the performance of the site and improve scalability from the end-user’s perspective.
